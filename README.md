# ComplexBased2D-ProteinPatternClassificationBy-ML
In this study, we propose a novel complex-based approach for 2D pattern representation of amino acid sequences. With this approach, 2D images obtained from amino acid sequences of two different protein families are tested on the classification problem with machine learning methods.
